        Waterloo. I recently relocated from Alberta. I am 19 years old, and I have no prior programming experience, but I
        am truly excited to learn new things and explore the world of technology and programming. The dynamic and
        forward-thinking community of Waterloo feels like the ideal setting for me to begin this exciting new chapter of
        my life.</p>

        things, contribute to this, and am determined and curious about anything.</p>
